# Defaults variables for role iscsid-target

# List of targets to configure, each entry needs at least one disk for backingstore, wwn and at least one initiator
# Worth noting that we'll create LV in VG if declared under disks
# default is no (in case of existing storage, or files, etc)
# If you want this role to also create, check lv_init, vg_name and lv_size
